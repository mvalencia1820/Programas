/*      fix_fft.c - Fixed-point Fast Fourier Transform  */
/*
   fix_fft()       perform FFT or inverse FFT
   window()        applies a Hanning window to the (time) input
   fix_loud()      calculates the loudness of the signal, for
   each freq point. Result is an integer array,
   units are dB (values will be negative).
   iscale()        scale an integer value by (numer/denom).
   fix_mpy()       perform fixed-point multiplication.
   Sinewave[1024]  sinewave normalized to 32767 (= 1.0).
   Loudampl[100]   Amplitudes for lopudnesses from 0 to -99 dB.
   Low_pass        Low-pass filter, cutoff at sample_freq / 4.

   All data are fixed-point short integers, in which
   -32768 to +32768 represent -1.0 to +1.0. Integer arithmetic
   is used for speed, instead of the more natural floating-point.

   For the forward FFT (time -> freq), fixed scaling is
   performed to prevent arithmetic overflow, and to map a 0dB
   sine/cosine wave (i.e. amplitude = 32767) to two -6dB freq
   coefficients; the one in the lower half is reported as 0dB
   by fix_loud(). The return value is always 0.

   For the inverse FFT (freq -> time), fixed scaling cannot be
   done, as two 0dB coefficients would sum to a peak amplitude of
   64K, overflowing the 32k range of the fixed-point integers.
   Thus, the fix_fft() routine performs variable scaling, and
   returns a value which is the number of bits LEFT by which
   the output must be shifted to get the actual amplitude
   (i.e. if fix_fft() returns 3, each value of fr[] and fi[]
   must be multiplied by 8 (2**3) for proper scaling.
   Clearly, this cannot be done within the fixed-point short
   integers. In practice, if the result is to be used as a
   filter, the scale_shift can usually be ignored, as the
   result will be approximately correctly normalized as is.

   TURBO C, any memory model; uses inline assembly for speed
   and for carefully-scaled arithmetic.
